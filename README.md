We should have one smart contract for setting up sub-accounts based on a listed suffix.

We should have another account for buying and selling of account names.


### TODO: 
- Author suffix account name listing smart contract


### Questions
Should we require that a subsequent bid be x% higher than the current bid?

Should there be a stop time for auctions, or should they be allowed to go until the seller is satisfied?

Is it possible to change keys (ownership) from within a smart contract?




### Process for Buying Sub-accounts
** This should be a new smart contract

1. List your account suffix in the listing table
2. Set the price for a sub-account using your suffix
3. Customer finds suffix and searches for account name
4. If account does not exist, they purchase
5. Funds are transferred appropriately
6. Account is created (need to figure out if account can be created from within a smart contract)
